In case of the single-player version, optimal computer strategies both for maximizing the expected average score and for maximizing the probability of beating a particular score are already known. However, when it comes to the multi-player version, those approaches are far too resource intensive and thus are not able to develop an optimal strategy given the current hardware.},
