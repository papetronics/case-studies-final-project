% Perfect place to drop any references that are too niche for the main text.
%
% Deep theoretical LR warmup papers if you only mention them briefly:
%   - kalra-2024-warmup (defined in 3_methods.bib)
%   - liu-2025-warmup-theory (defined in 3_methods.bib)
%
% Capacity/width bounds if you don't want them in the main methods:
%   - horne-1994-bounds-rnn-fsm (defined in 1_introduction.bib)
%   - hanin-2017-bounded-width-relu (defined in 1_introduction.bib)
%
% Extra methodology/background references you only allude to once:
%   - liu-2019-radam (defined in 3_methods.bib)
%   - Any other architecture papers you mention only in passing
%
% No new references needed for this section - just back-reference to earlier papers.
